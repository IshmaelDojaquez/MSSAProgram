# Monte_Carlo
Using the Monte-Carlo Method, the application uses System.Random to attain an X and Y coordinate [as many times as declared]. From there the coordinates are determined as inside 1.0 or outside 1.0; the inside 1.0 results are then calculated as an estimated result for PI. Lastly, the application takes the actual value of by and compares it to the calculated value.
